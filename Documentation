Risk Model:
  The important objects(Player, Country, Contienent) are stored in arraylists since they are the easiest to iterate through
1.Constructor:
  Intiates the players, countries and contienents list and also the parser object. Also intitates the createMap method in order to construct the game map.
  The constructor also starts the newGame method to determine amount of players and the player names and the play method to start the game.
  
2. createMap:
  It starts by initiating every country object in the game, since in order to add adjacent countries all countries must be intiated.
  Then proceeds to set all the adjacent countries. A list is used to be able to add all the adjacent countries as an arrayList into the the addAdjacentCountries method at once.
  Then all contienents are added
