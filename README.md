2. Allow single player with AI
3. Fixed Attack(), Deploy() and Fortify() to work with AI
4. Added a save / load from a text file
5. Updated our MapImport to work with a zip file containing a png(map image) and json(country info and adjacenies)
6. Added sequence diagrams for Deploy, Attack, Fortify, save/load
7. Moved a lot of model's responsibility to Controller.
8. Added sounds.

__Known issues:__

1. When the game ends, you have to restart manually. 
2. When a game that is deemed unplayable is loaded, you are prompted with a warning but you still can continue with the game.
3. Displaying some dice rolls is missing.
4. The maps folder must be present with the jar to start.
5. Game Saves are tied to Maps 

__Roadmap:__

As this is our final submission. We hope to have finished our project with a working/playable game. Even with a bumpy middle section, we hope to end strong.
