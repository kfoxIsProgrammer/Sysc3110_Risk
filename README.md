Changes from previous iteration:
This is the first iteration of the project. The only playable phase is the attack phase.

Known issues:
No feedback when entering the wrong commands in the attack phase. It simply takes you back to the main command menu.

Roadmap:
The next goal will be to a gui aspect to the project.
After that the rest of the phase will be added, including a deploy phase and a fortify phase. Will also add the ability to gain bonus troops every turn.
The final milestone is to add a save feature and a method to import custom maps.
