We have incorporated a map/data loader in anticipation for milestone 4. 
The model sends tranactional State information to the view using a Context class.

The next goal for our game is to introduce the playable Deploy and Fortify phases.
As well we want to further refine our design based on TA feedback to increase class cohesion.
The final milestone is to add a save feature and a method to import custom maps.
